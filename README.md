# Project title: Breaking Barriers: Enhancing Universal Dependency Parsing for Amharic
##                              Advancing NLP for A Low-Resource Language

This repository contains the resources and tools developed as part of a thesis project focused on improving 
Universal Dependency (UD) parsing for Amharic, a morphologically rich and low-resource language. 
By leveraging a state-of-the-art toolkit, this work aims to enhance parsing performance and contribute to 
the broader advancement of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages.

## Contents of this Repository
-Data: Annotated Treebanks and preprocessed datasets used for training and evaluation.
-Scripts: Python scripts for split, lemma-fill, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and analysis.
-Notes: Research notes, training results(metrics and verification), and observations made during model development.
-Thesis:The full thesis document detailing methodology, results, and discussions.

## Until the models are uploaded to the official Trankit website, trained parsing models can be downloaded or accessed using the following links:
